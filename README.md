WEEK 2 (Iteration/Selection) 
1. Extend exercise 6 from Week 1 to output a message if the user is 18 or older. 
2. Write a program that enables a student to enter a letter grade (A, B, C, D, E or F), then convert that to a university undergraduate classification (1st, 2:1, 2:2, 3rd, ordinary, fail). 
3. Output the digits between the range of 0 to 9 using a loop. 
4. Write a program that uses a loop to efficiently print the "seven times multiplication table". The output on screen should resemble the following: 
1 x 7 = 7 
2 x 7 = 14 
3 x 7 = 21 
4 x 7 = 28 
5 x 7 = 35 
6 x 7 = 42 
7 x 7 = 49 
8 x 7 = 56 
9 x 7 = 63 
10 x 7 = 70 
11 x 7 = 77 
12 x 7 = 84 
5. Now extend the previous program to ask the user to choose which number they would like to see. For example, the user would input 5 to then see the five-times-table or could then enter 9 for the nine-times-table. 
6. Extend the previous program to include a 'do while' loop that asks the user if they want to restart the program (to see a different times table). If the user does not wish to continue, then the program should display an appropriate 'goodbye' message. 
7. Write a new program that asks the user to enter an exam mark (0-100). Write conditional statements to print out the grade they would achieve from this mark. 
8. Write a program that will print only even numbers from a loop that repeats 10 times. 9. Amend exercise 5 from Week 1, which requires feet and miles to be output.
